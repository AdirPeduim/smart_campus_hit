## Project Overview 📋

Smart Campus is an innovative project aimed at enhancing campus management and sustainability efforts through advanced AI technology. The core objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated AI model capable of detecting anomalies in the data collected from various sensors installed across the campus. These sensors monitor crucial parameters such as electricity usage, barometric pressure, and temperature, providing valuable insights into the environmental conditions and resource utilization within campus facilities.

## Goals and Objectives 🎯

- **Anomaly Detection:** Implement an AI model that can identify unusual patterns or anomalies in sensor data, which could indicate potential issues or inefficiencies in campus operations. 🔍
- **Resource Optimization:** Use anomaly detection to improve the management of electricity and other resources, leading to more sustainable campus operations. 💡
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Monitor changes in environmental conditions through barometric pressure and temperature sensors, contributing to the health and safety of the campus community. 🌡️
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Empower campus administrators with actionable insights derived from sensor data, enabling informed decision-making regarding campus maintenance, safety, and sustainability initiatives. 📊

## Technical Approach 🔧

### Data Collection

The project begins with a comprehensive data collection phase, where we extract data from an SQL database. This database aggregates readings from various sensors deployed throughout the campus, encompassing electricity usage, barometric pressure, and temperature measurements.

### Data Processing

The collected data is processed using Python, within the Anaconda environment, which offers a robust platform for data analysis and machine learning tasks. Our data processing steps include:

- **Data Cleaning:** Removing inconsistencies and handling missing values to ensure the quality of the dataset. 🧹
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting and selecting relevant features from the sensor data that are most indicative of anomalies. 🔍
- **Normalization:** Standardizing the scale of the data to improve the performance of the AI model. ⚖️

### AI Model Development

We are employing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to develop the anomaly detection model. This phase involves:

- **Model Selection:** Evaluating different machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for anomaly detection in our context. 🤖
- **Training and Testing:** Using a portion of the processed data to train the model, and a separate set to test its accuracy and effectiveness. 📚
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tuning the model parameters to achieve the best possible performance in detecting anomalies. 🔧
